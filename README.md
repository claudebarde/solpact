_SOLPACT_

A simple Solidity to Compact compiler

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🚧**

The goal of the transpiler is to allow developers who are familiar with Solidity to write smart contracts that will then be transpiled to Compact and can be deployed to Midnight.

**WARNING ⚠️**

Solpact cannot transpile any Solidity contract to Compact. Although developers can use Solidity syntax and the produced contracts are 100% valid Solidity contracts, they must use different libraries (included in the package) to work and be transpiled correctly.
